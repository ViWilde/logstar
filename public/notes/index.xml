      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;Just as I&amp;#39;d hoped, the slingshot maneuver put us ahead of schedule; our navigator reports we should arrive at Serenity Valley within a week, if all goes well - which I&amp;#39;m sure it will. After all, what could go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;The ship is holding up wonderfully as well. If I didn&amp;#39;t know better I&amp;#39;d almost say she was excited.&#xA;The piloting has been easy enough that I&amp;#39;ve spent most of today just looking at the stars through the outboard cameras; they look so different, this far out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
