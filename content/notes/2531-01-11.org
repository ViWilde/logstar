* Tuesday Scene
- Linnaea eats some ferns
- The party spots the Wanderer, they come to a cautious "enemy of my enemy" alliance against Fey
- Wanderer says "the heart cannot be reasoned with"
- They spot a military plane; slime plane?

  
* Us
- Cliffside; loud screeching to the North
- Bus-sized Midas touch; the Heart creates mimicry of things it sees in our minds
- Weird quicksilver goo
  
* Finale
- Lots of things happen that I did not jot down
- Alan gains illegal amounts of it, gets possessed, becomes a miniboss
- Alan becomes the guardian of the Heart, cannot leave the mountain
- Linx (Corrin's dragon), including Linx's shadow-double, also get possessed
- Fortunately the Sol Authority shot them to death
- Koa drops some bombs
- We managed to keep Fey from completing her ritual, but then we had to stop the Wanderer from accessing+destroying the Heart.
- And we just about managed that. 
- Linnaea turned into a cryodrake a bunch, good for her.
- Esper nearly got killed by Asmodeus. Again. That bastard.
