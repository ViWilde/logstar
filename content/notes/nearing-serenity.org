Just as I'd hoped, the slingshot maneuver put us ahead of schedule; our navigator reports we should arrive at Serenity Valley within a week, if all goes well - which I'm sure it will. After all, what could go wrong?

The ship is holding up wonderfully as well. If I didn't know better I'd almost say she was excited.
The piloting has been easy enough that I've spent most of today just looking at the stars through the outboard cameras; they look so different, this far out.

I even spotted a constellation of an almost perfect skull and crossbones, and another that looks like what Old Earth called a "biohazard symbol". They looked so exquisite, I'm only sad our trajectory doesn't let us get a closer view of them.
