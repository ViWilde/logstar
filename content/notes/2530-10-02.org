- Bryce is in cryo, what will he do?
- The bughunter VR game is gone.
- Nora: Here to assess our landing planet for a potential naval base.
- We're making the jump. It's me and Rick /fucking/ Oakley.
- ALAN is doing weird science on subspace, hanging out on the outside of the ship.
- ALAN can explicitly feel pain. Good to know.
- The fuel hasn't been taken care of; some kind of contaminant.
- Rick's a fucking dipshit
- The jump was shorter than expected; we lost contact with some of Nora's drones
- Our momentum is higher than it ought to be. Like we were pulled out of the jump early.
- The sun is yellow, not green.
- We're caught by something like a tractor beam.
- The lights cut, and came back red. Suddenly, we're closer to the planet, and some strange stuff is happening in the engine room (discharge from the J-drive)
- We can try to jettison some colony buildings.
- Ava was woken up by Colonel Payne (dipshit), it seems. Entirely possible they were also awoken by the red light flash, if we're being paranoiacs.
- The navy is breaking protocol by waking people up
- Comms are down
- J-drive exploded
- One of the cryopods was lost/damaged in the badlands
- Some military folk ejected over the badlands/fog
- We ejected all cryos and shuttles
- We're fucked.
- The lab's been damaged, our scientists are hurting
- Dr Elloise has made her escape (?)
- There's important research being done on animals, who are running wild.
- Welp we lost our main scientist.
- So all the PCs are off ship.
- It looks like Rick probably died. Doing my job, to the bitter end. While I ran away.
- Possibility (OOC speculation): Fungus contaminant is somehow "aware", pulled us out of orbit
