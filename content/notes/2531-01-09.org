- The Midas Touch (and Martinez' encampment) is under attack on both flanks from Fey's forces; Nisha commanding one flank and Fish (a psychotic bloodlust-driven slime I think?) on the other
- Additionally, they have air support in the form of skywhales
- Lodestar military is outnumbered
- Linnaea Borealis is a skywhale singing whalesong, to inflict emotions on the enemy whales. She declined to give the whales gender dysphoria, but she did attempt to make them bewildered, nauseous, and hungry (to varying degrees of success)
- Joe Brew is also here, with a cult of rock gnomes willing to fight to the death for him. This will definitely cause no problems in the long run
- Esper has been given access to three Sol Authority strike fighters; for air-to-air combat, or strafing runs. She's piloting them in formation via shipmind
- Heather Lynser is running diplomacy, between Martinez and Redjoy (who is the general of Fey's side right now)
- The ship is breached, but we're able to defeat the enemy before it becomes a problem
- Esper is 30 seconds away from deciding "Ok Nisha's causing us a lot of trouble, lets see if we can snipe her" when negotiations begin and Heather asks us not to kill Nisha.
- A truce is achieved! Then the mountain suddenly begins shaking angrily, Director Chelnikova makes her appearance, and after Heather chews me out for dragging the Sol Authority into this, we proceed to the mountain
