Puzzling out the planet, one step at a time
* Character Justification
Esper is, in character, not that smart, and not that curious - she's more concerned.

She is, however, driven by wanderlust. This is suppressed by the crushing guilt and related emotions for now, but there is a way to play her that balances the crushing guilt and the wanderlust.
So her "mystery-solving" is not "I need to solve the puzzle", but "I want to see more even if I don't understand it, because this is strange and wonderful".
And the conspiracy board obssessive mystery solving can be an OOC Vivienne special.
This is fine.

Also she does have an emotional connection to Lodestar, if it turns out they're up to their necks in weird spooky stuff and hiding it, she might take an interest.

* Threads
** Colors
- The color green can do all sorts of strange things in this place...
- Westfall knows more.
- TODO: Investigate colors on the IR/UV spectra; anything particularly striking?
- Do symbols correspond to colors? The weird symbol Martin saw caused the purple moss to disintegrate. Some kind of create/destroy system?
- Colors and symbols on the charsheet
** Time Dilation
- Something strange is up. An expedition that landed 30 years ago?
- TODO I know this came up but I don't remember the context
- This feels closely related to the trousers of time, somehow.
** Trousers of Time
- Evelyn: The rocks resemble volcanic glass. However, the reflection is not volcanic glass, kaleidoscopic. More fodder for trousers of time
- Consolus sees something strange on touching the rock. Specifically, he sees himself die in the crash. So, an AU where the dice rolls worked out slightly differently?
- We pulled the data - camera records, etc. to analyse outside the ship. We see fragments from alternate realities - like several tapes have melded into one, and a random one gets selected.
- Why can the radio breach timelines? Is it the volcanic glass?

** Former Expedition
- A language that we must understand to progress past whatever gate they... made? found?
- A language of colors and symbols?
** Doppelgangers
- The Hypno Flies look a bit like Earth’s fireflies, ‘cept they’re bigger, they're bluer, and they do all sorts of creepy things to your brain. A few minutes after looking into one of their lights, they had me hallucinating an old friend from Harkness 13 and a crew injury that never happened
** Intelligent Design
- J-drive fuel blood on the crystal-hopper
- Cryo fuel in the desert Radices
- Janus-Skulker symbols
- In the middle of an irradiated desert, there’s a natural substance that can treat radiation. It’s almost like this whole planet is one giant puzzle.
- Lots of radiation-y and electric life forms on this planet. Why? What's going on?
** Just weird shit
- Different, moving sparkles in the distance (within the hills) - an organism (heat signature)
- Fuel contaminants on the ship during Wide Awake
- Floating Rocks (in multiple locations) that force resolve checks
# - Ghosts/Hallucinations
- Did something drive Kernel Payne mad?
- Something piloted the shuttle down into the jungle - "She" that the robot knows about - Kiki Fey, perhaps?
- Rick is stuck on his reality's version of the ship, but able to interact with us via the radio. What the fuck.
