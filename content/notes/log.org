A general log of NPCs and resources.
Specifically, the ones we're choosing not to share with the broader group
* PCs
- Lt Nora Bellringer :: You were in the fog, but now you're the only military PC not on shortwave central. Are you dead, AWOL, lying low, or secret n+1th thing?
* Resources
- Armory: Western edge of the hills
- Shuttle 1: Cave somewhere
- Shuttle 2: Snowy peak (near Raul?)
- Shuttle 3: Jungles
