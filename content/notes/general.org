* Piloting A Ship
- During jumps: These last ~24-48 hours. We're operating in subspace (weird grey ethereal space). Dealing with turbulence, micro-adjustments, staying precisely on course, etc. Space is distorted, immense mental pressure, so piloting in those circumstances is common.
- Shuttles: On-ground transport, designed for away teams, but also useful for getting around, or for getting to a nearby station to request rescue.
- Subspace messages: burst of dangerous energy, to send FTL messages.
