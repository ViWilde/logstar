* Calls
** Halifax
- Administrator, Evelyn's boss.
- Payne tried to shoot Halifax, is being shamed, dishonored, posthumously fired, etc.
- "There are things here I think Lodestar will be very interested in"
- "Things maybe more imoportant than getting to Serenity"
- Keep a look out for interesting things.
- There are some powerful things here. Medicines, etc.
- This could be a new home!
- "We really need a win and I think this planet could be it"
** Rick
- Something strange outside the ship.
- In our (i.e Esper) world, he thinks.
- Not a monster - robots(?)
- Purple light, purple moss, here to fix the ship.
- NOTE: Purple moss was destroyed by the door.
- Sent by the Duke
- They will wait for instructions/commands before actually beginning their work
- Martin doesn't trust him (Duke).
- Conclusions: We are stalling. So the robots are still outside the ship, but not on board.
* Snap back to reality there goes gravity
- Machine gun guy
- Pistol guy
- Third guy I missed
- Suits: Two people with lodestar costumes (current), one without.
- The snake is beginning to twitch, it regenerates.
- The french guy is not with Lodestar? He mentioned "their company".
- They're Viktor Krahl, Leo Jacinto or Joaquin Philips.
- Well, Joaquin is confirmed, the second person is confirmed Vik, the third is Tizahn (spelling)?
- Five people (NPCs) in this company
- So one might be Leo.
- Something green is growing out of my wound.
- Languages: Knows English well, and enough Mandarin to get by - not pretty, but she can understand+speak the basics. /Possibly/ a bit of Spanish.
- The soldiers speak a language none of us do.
** Snake Bite
- We took a sidebar to investigate wounds, while Martin+Evelyn make friends with the soldiers.
- Good news: Not venomous
- Bad news: Something squirming around in there. Some kind of parasitoid-wasp type setup?
- The parasite is a little green worm, we've captured one of them to study.
** Diplomacy
- Vik is trying to figure us out
- Diversity win! The Lodestar military guys we ran into aren't homophobic!
** Tracking
- They apparently have radios
- "Potential sighting location, stay tuned for updates"
- We reach a clearing
- A metal grate, with a symbol.
- So a new companion to the door.
- The symbol looks a little bit like a bird.
- Vik is speaking Croatian.
- We've found the hideout of the Lady of the jungle (we think) 
- The soldiers pulled guns on us, we parted frostily. They're exploring the hatch, we're going on our main mission
** Encounter
- A strange grove of flowers with teal leaves and a sweet smelling fruit. Like cinnamon.
- It has sharp teeth-like tendrils.
- There's a rock moving towards us. With 6 eyes. Like a snail/turtle
- With sharp tentacles (30ft long)
- -1 revolver shot
- Martin takes damage
- Some kind of mollusc.
- The moon(s) shine strangely; each moon separately. One is red, one is green, one is blue.
*** Shuttle
- It's Ashleigh!
- There are beeps over the radio. An SOS
- Subspace drive isn't functioning. Shuttle is in a tight spot, a lot of things around
**** Combat
- It's Vik and the goons, they want to use the shuttle jdrive to escape, and plan to force Juniper to engineer it.
- They have a machine gun and rocket launcher
- They are the ones who locked the ship down
- DUKE offers (over Martin's radio) to help us unlock the shuttle. 
- They do it remotely, by wiring the radio to the console.
- Gave us back control of the ship
- We have plans to meet them at Erebor once we finish the rescue.
- We made it out, barely.
- We lost Gretel.
